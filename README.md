# About the Benchmark.pdf
This is a supplementary document to the paper: Multi-channel Opportunistic Access for Heterogeneous Networks Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning. In this document, we derive the optimal network throughputs when the Multi-channel Deep-reinforcement Learning Multiple Access (MC-DLMA) node coexists with the nodes using other protocols in various multi-channel heterogeneous wireless network (HetNet) scenarios. Then we use these optimal network throughputs as upper bound benchmarks for our paper.
