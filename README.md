# A introduction to MC-DLMA
MC-DLMA is a multi-channel medium access control (MAC) protocol for heterogeneous wirless networking. The underpinning technique of MC-DLMA is deep Q-network (DQN) in deep-reinforcement learning (DRL). 
# About the benchmark.pdf
We provide the detailed derivations for the optimal network throughput in various multi-channel heterogeneous scenarios. Then we use the optimal network throughput as the benchmark for our paper:  Multi-channel Opportunistic Access for Heterogeneous Networks Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning.
