# A introduction to MC-DLMA
M-DLMA is a multi-channel medium access control (MAC) protocol for heterogeneous wirless networking. The underpinning technique of M-DLMA is deep Q-network (DQN) in deep-reinforcement learning (DRL). 
# About the benchmark.pdf
We provide the detailed derivations for the optimal network throughput in various multi-channel heterogeneous scenarios. Then we use the optimal network throughput as the benchmark for our paper: MAC protocol for Multi-channel heterogeneous networks Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning.
# About the LSTM-RNN-FNN.pdf
we compare the performance of LSTM with simple RNN and FNN in MC-DLMA design. Specifically, We first give the network architecture of LSTM, RNN, and FNN, respectively. Then we combine the three neural networks with MC-DLMA one by one to analyze their performance.
